# Industrial Equipment Failure Prediction Risk Engine

A machine learning-based system that predicts industrial equipment failure and classifies risk levels using sensor data.

Built using Random Forest, the system processes synthetic sensor inputs and identifies risks as High, Medium, or Low.

Includes a Streamlit dashboard for uploading data, visualizing predictions, and downloading sample CSVs.

 Note: Upload the provided sample CSV for correct format. Custom uploads may cause errors if format differs.
