# Factory Equipment Failure Prediction System with Risk Engine

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict factory equipment failure using synthetic sensor data and classify the associated risk level. It includes a visual Streamlit dashboard that allows users or recruiters to upload data, visualize results, and analyze failure probabilities.

## üìÑ How to Use

1. Click **"Download Sample CSV"** inside the dashboard to get a correctly formatted file.
2. Upload the downloaded CSV into the app.
3. View predictions, risk levels, and visualizations.

> **Note for Recruiters:**
> If you're reviewing this project, please download the sample CSV file using the in-dashboard button before uploading it. Direct uploads of arbitrary or incompatible CSVs will lead to errors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Classification

Risk is classified based on the predicted failure probability as follows:

* **Low Risk:** Probability < 0.4
* **Medium Risk:** 0.4 ‚â§ Probability < 0.7
* **High Risk:** Probability ‚â• 0.7

You can modify these thresholds in `src/inference.py`.
